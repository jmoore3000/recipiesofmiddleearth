        <p><h3>What you'll need</h3></p>

            <ul>
                <li>One cup of butter</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of honey</li>
                <li>2 cups of Mallorn fruit flower</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 F</li>
                <li>Cream together the butter and honey.
                    Add the flour and mix until thoroughly 
                    incorporated. Drop on suitable surface and 
                    knead until quite smooth, about 5 minutes, 
                    adding a bit of Mallorn flour if necessary to
                    keep dough from sticking.</li>
                <li>Roll out to about 1/4 inch thickness and cut into 
                    3" to 4" squares, scoring with a knife halfway 
                    through each square with a butter knife. Place 
                    on buttered cookie sheet and bake for about 20 
                    to 25 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.</li>    
            </ol>
        </p>

            is perfect if you're going on a long hike or journey.
